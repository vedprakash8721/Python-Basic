        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "-   Python is a high-level programming language that’s really popular because it’s simple to learn and easy to read. It looks a lot like English, so even beginners can start coding quickly. It’s also super flexible—you can use it for web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and much more. Another reason people love it is because there’s a huge community behind it, so there are lots of resources, libraries, and support available. Plus, it works on all major operating systems, and it comes with a big set of built-in tools that make programming easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "-   An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Instead of converting the whole program into machine code at once like a compiler, the interpreter runs each line one at a time, which makes it easier to test and debug your code. So when you write and run a Python script, the interpreter is the one actually reading your code and making it work immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "-   Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that are reserved by the language because they have specific meanings and functions. You can’t use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers. These keywords are part of the syntax and structure of Python—for example, if, else, while, for, def, return, and class. They help Python understand what kind of action you want your code to perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "-   No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Since keywords have special meanings in the language, using them as variable names would confuse the interpreter. For example, trying to name a variable if or class will result in a syntax error because Python expects those words to be used for control flow or defining classes, not for storing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "-   Mutability in Python refers to whether or not an object can be changed after it is created. If an object is mutable, you can change its content without changing its identity. Examples of mutable objects include lists, dictionaries, and sets. If an object is immutable, it cannot be changed once it's created—any modification results in a new object. Examples of immutable objects are strings, integers, and tuples. Understanding mutability helps you avoid bugs when passing data around in your programs.\n",
        "6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "-    Lists are mutable because they are designed to store a collection of items that might change over time—you can add, remove, or modify elements in a list after it's created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable by design to ensure that their contents remain constant. This immutability makes tuples more memory-efficient and safer to use when you need fixed data, like as keys in dictionaries or for returning multiple values from a function without risking accidental changes.\n",
        "7.  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "-    In Python, == checks whether the values of two variables are the same, while is checks whether they refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "- a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "print(a == b)  # True, because the values in both lists are the same\n",
        "print(a is b)  # False, because they are two different objects in memory\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "-   Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements or boolean values (True or False). The main logical operators are:\n",
        "\n",
        "and: Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "- x = 5\n",

        "print(not(x > 0))  # False, because the condition is true\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "-   Type casting in Python refers to converting one data type into another. Python allows you to change a variable's type using explicit type conversion (also called type casting) or implicit type conversion (done automatically by Python).\n",
        "\n",

        "-      Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is True or False. They are essential for decision-making, enabling the program to react differently based on varying conditions or inputs.\n",
        "\n",

        "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "-   The elif (short for \"else if\") statement in Python allows you to check multiple conditions in a sequence. It provides an additional condition to check after the initial if condition. If the if condition is false, Python evaluates the elif conditions one by one. If one of the elif conditions is true, its corresponding block of code is executed. If none of the if or elif conditions are true, the else block (if present) is executed.\n",
